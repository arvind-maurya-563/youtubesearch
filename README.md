# YouTube Clone

**This is the clone of the Youtube Web APP. YouTube is a website for sharing videos. It was registered on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim, three former employees of the American e-commerce company PayPal. They had the idea that ordinary people would enjoy sharing their “home videos.” The company is headquartered in San Bruno, California. Shortly after the site opened on a limited (“beta”) basis in May 2005, it was attracting some 30,000 visitors per day.**
